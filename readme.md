# Parkour.io


I've had the idea of this very game since what it feels like forever. A parkour stickfigure time-trials game. When Mirros Edge came the online section of it was was a 3D-version of my vision, battling other players ghots runs. A lot has happened since then but this game idea is still something I just can't let go. I've made numerous of small proof-of-concepts using different game engines over the time but never really managed to climb the mountain of gamedev. Time after time i find myself struggling and loosing interest as the project steers into something I was not really interested in, like hosting, server/client communication general backend and devops stuff.

Will this time be different? I'll start this project by archiving the previous version built on lance-gg where I dreamt on real time multiplayer support. Let's just stay with the stick figure ghost time trials thing this time =)
